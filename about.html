                <p>There we go. Zip. That easy. This is your world. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Be brave. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. In this world, everything can be happy. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Let's build an almighty mountain. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Get tough with it, get strong. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. We'll play with clouds today. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. This is unplanned it really just happens.</p>
